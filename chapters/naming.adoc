== {MUST-SHOULD} Use Functional Naming Schema

Functional naming is a powerful, yet easy way to align global resources as
_host_, _permission_, and _event names_ within an the application landscape. It
helps to preserve uniqueness of names while giving readers meaningful context
information about the addressed component. Besides, the most important aspect
is, that it allows to keep APIs stable in the case of technical and
organizational changes (Zalando for example maintains an internal naming convention).

To make use of this advantages for APIs with a larger <<219, audience>> we
strongly recommended to follow the functional naming schema for <<224,
hostnames>>, <<215, permission names>>, and <<213, event names>> in APIs as
follows:

[cols="25%,75%,options="header"]
|=========================================================
| *Functional Naming* | *Audience*
| *must*   | external-public, external-partner
| *should* | company-internal, business-unit-internal
| *may*    | component-internal
|=========================================================

To conduct the functional naming schema, a unique `functional-name` is assigned
to each functional component. It is built of the domain name of the functional
group the component is belonging to and a unique a short identifier for the
functional component itself:

[source,bnf]
----
<functional-name>       ::= <functional-domain>-<functional-component>
<functional-domain>     ::= [a-z][a-z0-9]*  -- managed functional group of components
<functional-component>  ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]* -- name of owning functional component
----

*Internal Hint*:  Use the simple 
https://github.bus.zalan.do/team-architecture/functional-component-registry[functional
name registry (internal link)] to register your functional name before using
it. The registry is a centralized infrastructure service to ensure uniqueness
of your functional names (and available domains) and to support hostname DNS
resolution.

Please see the following rules for detailed functional naming patterns:

* <<224>>
// * <<225>>
* <<213>>

[#224]
== {MUST} Follow Naming Convention for Hostnames

Hostnames in APIs must, respectively should conform to the functional naming
depending on the <<219, audience>> as follows (see <<223>> for details and
`<functional-name>` definition):

[source,bnf]
-----
<hostname>             ::= <functional-hostname> | <application-hostname>

<functional-hostname>  ::= <functional-name>.zalandoapis.com
-----

The following application specific legacy convention is *only* allowed for
hostnames of <<223, internal>> APIs:

[source,bnf]
-----
<application-hostname> ::= <application-id>.<organization-unit>.zalan.do
<application-id>       ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- application identifier
<organization-id>      ::= [a-z][a-z0-9-]*  -- organization unit identifier, e.g. team identifier
-----

[#129]
== {MUST} Use lowercase separate words for Path Segments

Example:

[source,http]
----
/croporder/{cropOrderId}
----

This applies to concrete path segments and not the names of path
parameters. For example `{cropOrderId}` would be ok as a path
parameter.

[#130]
== {MUST} Use lowerCamelCase for Query Parameters

Examples:

[source]
----
toolIdentifier, fieldId
----

[#132]
== {SHOULD} Prefer Hyphenated-Pascal-Case for HTTP header Fields

This is for consistency in your documentation (most other headers follow
this convention). Avoid camelCase (without hyphens). Exceptions are
common abbreviations like "ID."

Examples:

[source,http]
----
Accept-Encoding
Apply-To-Redirect-Ref
Disposition-Notification-Options
Original-Message-ID
----

See also: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-22[HTTP Headers are
case-insensitive (RFC 7230)].

See <<common-headers>> and <<proprietary-headers>> sections for more guidance
on HTTP headers.

[#134]
== {MUST} Pluralize Resource Names

Usually, a collection of resource instances is provided (at least API
should be ready here). The special case of a resource singleton is a
collection with cardinality 1.

[#135]
== {MAY} Use /api as first Path Segment

In most cases, all resources provided by a service are part of the
public API, and therefore should be made available under the root "/"
base path. If the service should also support non-public, internal APIs
— for specific operational support functions, for example — add "/api"
as base path to clearly separate public and non-public API resources.

[#136]
== {MUST} Avoid Trailing Slashes

The trailing slash must not have specific semantics. Resource paths must
deliver the same results whether they have the trailing slash or not.

[#137]
== {MAY} Use Conventional Query Strings

If you provide query support for sorting, pagination, filtering
functions or other actions, use the following standardized naming
conventions:

* `q` — default query parameter (e.g. used by browser tab completion);
should have an entity specific alias, like sku
* `limit` — to restrict the number of entries. See Pagination section
below. Hint: You can use size as an alternate query string.
* `cursor` — key-based page start. See <<pagination>> section below.
* `offset` — numeric offset page start. See <<pagination>> section below.
Hint: In combination with limit, you can use page as an alternative to
offset.
* `sort` — comma-separated list of fields to sort. To indicate sorting
direction, fields may be prefixed with + (ascending) or - (descending,
default), e.g. /sales-orders?sort=+id
* `fields` — to retrieve a subset of fields. See
<<157,_Support Filtering of Resource Fields_>> below.
* `embed` — to expand embedded entities (ie.: inside of an article
entity, expand silhouette code into the silhouette object). Implementing
"expand" correctly is difficult, so do it with care.
