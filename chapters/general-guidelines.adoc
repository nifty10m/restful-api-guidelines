[#100]
== {MUST} Follow API First Principle

You must follow the <<api-first, API First Principle>>, more specifically: 

* You must define APIs first, before coding its implementation, <<101, using OpenAPI as specification language>>
* You must design your APIs consistently with this guidelines; 
use our https://zally.zalando.net/[API Linter Service [internal link]] for automated rule checks. 
* You must call for early review feedback from peers and client developers, 
and apply https://github.bus.zalan.do/ApiGuild/ApiReviewProcedure[our lightweight API
review process [internal link]] for all component external APIs, i.e. 
all apis with `x-api-audience =/= component-internal` (see <<219, API Audience>>). 


[#101]
== {MUST} Provide API Specification using OpenAPI

We use the http://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI specification] (aka
Swagger specification) as standard to define API specifications files.
API designers have to provide the API specification files using *JSON*
to improve readability. Please, use *OpenAPI 3.0* even if there might
be still missing tooling support which is in beta.

The API specification files should be subject to version control using
a source code management system - best together with the implementing sources. 

[#102]
== {SHOULD} Provide API User Manual

In addition to the API Specification, it is good practice to provide an
API user manual to improve client developer experience, especially of
engineers that are less experienced in using this API. A helpful API user
manual typically describes the following API aspects:

* API scope, purpose, and use cases
* concrete examples of API usage
* edge cases, error situation details, and repair hints
* architecture context and major dependencies - including figures and
sequence flows

The user manual must be published online, e.g. via our documentation hosting platform service, or specific team web servers. Please do not forget to include a link to the 
API user manual into the API specification using the `#/externalDocs/url` property.

The manual is generated to build/generated-resources/main/src/index.html

[#103]
== {MUST} Write APIs in U.S. English
