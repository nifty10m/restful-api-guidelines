[#173]
== {SHOULD} Use a Common Money Object

Use the following common money structure:

[source,yaml]
----
Money:
  type: object
  properties:
    amount:
      type: number
      description: Amount expressed as a decimal number of major currency units
      format: decimal
      example: 99.95
    currency:
      type: string
      description: 3 letter currency code as defined by ISO-4217
      format: iso-4217
      example: EUR
  required:
    - amount
    - currency
----

The decimal values for "amount" describe unit and subunit of the
currency in a single value, where the digits before the decimal point
are for the major unit and the digits after the decimal point are for
the minor unit. Note that some business cases (e.g. transactions in
Bitcoin) call for a higher precision, so applications must be prepared
to accept values with unlimited precision, unless explicitly stated
otherwise in the API specification. Examples for correct representations
(in EUR):

* `42.20` or `42.2` = 42 Euros, 20 Cent
* `0.23` = 23 Cent
* `42.0` or `42` = 42 Euros
* `1024.42` = 1024 Euros, 42 Cent
* `1024.4225` = 1024 Euros, 42.25 Cent

Make sure that you don’t convert the "amount" field to `float` /
`double` types when implementing this interface in a specific language
or when doing calculations. Otherwise, you might lose precision.
Instead, use exact formats like Java’s
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html[`BigDecimal`].
See http://stackoverflow.com/a/3730040/342852[Stack Overflow] for more
info.

Some JSON parsers (NodeJS’s, for example) convert numbers to floats by
default. After discussing the pros and cons we’ve decided on "decimal" as our amount format. It
is not a standard OpenAPI format, but should help us to avoid parsing numbers
as float / doubles.

[#174]
== {MUST} Use common field names and semantics

There exist a variety of field types that are required in multiple
places. To achieve consistency across all API implementations, you must
use common field names and semantics whenever applicable.

[[generic-fields]]
=== Generic Fields

There are some data fields that come up again and again in API data:

* `id`: the identity of the object. If used, IDs must be opaque strings and
not numbers. IDs are unique within some documented context, are stable
and don't change for a given object once assigned, and are never
recycled cross entities.
* `xyzId`: an attribute within one object holding the identifier of
another object must use a name that corresponds to the type of the
referenced object or the relationship to the referenced object followed
by `Id` (e.g. `customerId` not `customerNumber`; `parentNodeId` for
the reference to a parent node from a child node, even if both have the
type `Node`)
* `createdAt`: when the object was created. If used, this must be a
`date-time` construct.
* `modifiedAt`: when the object was updated. If used, this must be a
`date-time` construct.
* `type`: the kind of thing this object is. If used, the type of this
field should be a string. Types allow runtime information on the entity
provided that otherwise requires examining the Open API file.
* `etag`: the <<182, ETag>> of an <<158, embedded sub-resource>>.
It may be used to carry the ETag for subsequent PUT calls (see <<etag-in-result-entities>>).

Example JSON schema:

[source,json]
----
{
  "treeNode": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "description": " the identifier of this node",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "createdAt": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "date-time"
      },
      "modifiedAt": {
        "description": "when got this node last updated",
        "type": "string",
        "format": "date-time"
      },
      "type": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "LEAF",
          "NODE"
        ]
      },
      "parentNodeId": {
        "description": "the identifier of the parent node of this node",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "example": {
      "id": "123435",
      "created": "2017-04-12T23:20:50.52Z",
      "modified": "2017-04-12T23:20:50.52Z",
      "type": "LEAF",
      "parent_node_id": "534321"
    }
  }
}
----

These properties are not always strictly necessary, but making them
idiomatic allows API client developers to build up a common
understanding of Zalando's resources. There is very little utility for
API consumers in having different names or value types for these fields
across APIs.

[[address-fields]]
=== Address Fields

Address structures play a role in different functional and use-case
contexts, including country variances. All attributes that relate to
address information should follow the naming and semantics defined
below.

[source,json]
----
{
  "addressee": {
    "description": "a (natural or legal) person that gets addressed",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "salutation": {
        "description": "a salutation and/or title used for personal contacts to some\naddressee; not to be confused with the gender information!\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "Mr"
      },
      "first_name": {
        "description": "given name(s) or first name(s) of a person; may also include the\nmiddle names.\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "Hans Dieter"
      },
      "last_name": {
        "description": "family name(s) or surname(s) of a person\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "Mustermann"
      },
      "business_name": {
        "description": "company name of the business organization. Used when a business is\nthe actual addressee; for personal shipments to office addresses, use\n`care_of` instead.\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "Consulting Services GmbH"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "first_name",
      "last_name"
    ]
  },
  "address": {
    "description": "an address of a location/destination",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "care_of": {
        "description": "(aka c/o) the person that resides at the address, if different from\naddressee. E.g. used when sending a personal parcel to the\noffice /someone else's home where the addressee resides temporarily\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "Consulting Services GmbH"
      },
      "street": {
        "description": "the full street address including house number and street name\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "Schönhauser Allee 103"
      },
      "additional": {
        "description": "further details like building name, suite, apartment number, etc.\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "2. Hinterhof rechts"
      },
      "city": {
        "description": "name of the city / locality\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "Berlin"
      },
      "zip": {
        "description": "zip code or postal code\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": 14265
      },
      "country_code": {
        "description": "the country code according to\n[iso-3166-1-alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)\n",
        "type": "string",
        "example": "DE"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "street",
      "city",
      "zip",
      "country_code"
    ]
  }
}
----

Grouping and cardinality of fields in specific data types may vary based
on the specific use case (e.g. combining addressee and address fields
into a single type when modeling an address label vs distinct addressee
and address types when modeling users and their addresses).
